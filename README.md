## Data Storage

Currently uses browser localStorage for data persistence. This means:
- Data is stored locally in each browser
- Data persists across sessions
- For production use, consider implementing a backend API

**Note:** This app uses localStorage, so data is stored locally in each browser. For multi-user scenarios, consider implementing a backend solution.
